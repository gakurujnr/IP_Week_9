# Titanic And Spam Project
I have applied supervised learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, KNN, Bernoulli BayesNB, naive Bayes, XGBoost to solving business problem.

## Defining the QUestion

## Defining the Data Analytic Question


Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets.


For dataset 1, because we don't have the label for the test set, we will use the train set to create train and test data(i.e splitting further), then performing thr K-nearet neighbour classification.

## Recording the Experimental Design
